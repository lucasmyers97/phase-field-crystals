Phase-field crystals
====================

This repository contains code for a finite element solver used to implement the [phase-field crystal model](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.054113).
The code is based on the [deal.II finite element library](dealii.org).
The first step is to write code for the time evolution of a 2-dimensional hexagonal lattice.
This README will be updated as the repository is expanded and organizational choices are made.
